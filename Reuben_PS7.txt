Explanation of the data: Prior research has shown that subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 
or a self-experienced persistent decline in cognitive capacity, is associated with an increased likelihood
for conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, women with early estrogen loss 
due to oophorectomy (ovarian removal) prior to spontaneous menopause, have an increased risk of AD in later years. 
Therefore the current study aims to examine the effect of SCD on cognition in women with oophorectomy (BSO) 
as compared to age-matched controls (AMC).

IVs: SCD status (yes/no); group status (BSO/AMC)
Covariates: age; Education (edu_years); Estrogen Level (E1G); depressive mood (CESD)
DVs: Neuropsychological battery -- Logical Memory, RAVLT, Digits Backwards, 
Digit Ordering Task, Spatial Working Memory Task, Verbal Fluency
